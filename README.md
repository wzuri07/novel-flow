# 📖 Novel Flow — AI-Powered Chinese Web Novel Reader

A personal PWA (Progressive Web App) that fetches chapters from [lnmtl.com](https://lnmtl.com), extracts the machine-translated text, and polishes it using a local AI (Ollama) or Google Gemini API — so you can actually enjoy reading Chinese web novels in English.

## ✨ Features

- 📥 Fetch any chapter directly from lnmtl.com by pasting the URL
- 🤖 AI grammar smoothing via **Ollama** (local, free, private) or **Google Gemini** (fast, free tier)
- 🔄 Streaming output — text appears as it's generated, no waiting for the full chapter
- 📖 Clean reader interface with dark/light mode
- 🔤 Adjustable font size
- ⬅️ ➡️ Previous / Next chapter navigation
- 📱 Installable as a PWA on Android and iOS
- 🔒 100% private — all processing happens on your own PC

## ⚙️ Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (LTS version)
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com) installed on your PC
- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) (optional, for phone access from anywhere)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/wzuri07/novel-flow.git
cd novel-flow

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install the CORS proxy globally
npm install -g local-cors-proxy
```

### Pull an AI model

```bash
ollama pull gemma3:12b   # High quality, slower (recommended for 16GB+ RAM)
ollama pull gemma3:4b    # Faster, good quality (recommended for 8GB RAM)
```

### Start everything

Either run the batch file (Windows):

```

```

Or manually in separate terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Start Ollama
set OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*
set OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434
ollama serve

# Terminal 2 — Start CORS proxy
lcp --proxyUrl https://lnmtl.com --port 8010 --proxyPartial proxy

npm run dev
```

Then open your browser at:

### Extension features

- Extracts visible chapter text from `lnmtl.com`
- Sends chapter text to OpenAI for grammar/readability cleanup
- Renders improved text in the side panel

### Load it in Chrome

1. Open `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer mode**
